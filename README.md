# MachineLearningExamples
## About this Repository
Hi, my name is Anirudh Pai and I created this repository to document my journey as I learn about new machine learning algorithms and how to implement them in code.
This repository contains code samples for the algorithms that I talk about on my website, http://www.machinelearningworks.com.  
Furthermore, I have included the code for recent projects that I have been working on. The explanation for this code is also on my website 

## Procedure
You can download the repository with SSH: `git clone git@github.com:apai25/MachineLearningExamples.git`. 
or with HTTPS:  
`git clone https://github.com/apai25/MachineLearningExamples.git`. 
You can also download the repository as a .zip file.  
Each folder contains a dataset and the corresponding code that I discuss on my website.
